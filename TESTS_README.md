# Custom Order Fix Tests

This directory contains several test scripts to verify that the fixes for the custom order issues have been properly implemented.

## Issue Background

There were two main issues that needed to be fixed:

1. **INSERT Statement Error**: The INSERT statement in the respond_to_custom_order.php files was using incorrect column names, causing SQL errors.

2. **Declined Custom Orders Issue**: When a freelancer declined a custom order, an order entry was still being created with 'Order Placed' status, which was incorrect behavior.

## Test Scripts

### 1. test_fix_plain.php

This script tests if the INSERT statement fix is working correctly. It:
- Checks if the orders table exists and displays its structure
- Tests the fixed INSERT statement to ensure it works
- Verifies that the PHP files have been updated with the correct INSERT statement

### 2. test_custom_order_status_fix.php

This script tests if the custom order status fix is working correctly. It:
- Checks if the respond_to_custom_order.php files have been updated with the correct comment
- Verifies that orders are only created when a custom order is accepted, not when it's declined
- Checks the database for any orders that were created from declined custom orders

### 3. test_all_fixes.php

This is a comprehensive test script that combines all the tests from the above scripts. It:
- Checks if all required tables exist
- Tests the INSERT statement fix
- Verifies that the PHP files have been updated with the correct INSERT statement
- Checks if the respond_to_custom_order.php files have been updated with the correct comment
- Verifies that no orders exist that were created from declined custom orders

## Running the Tests

You can run each test script individually using PHP:

```bash
php test_fix_plain.php
php test_custom_order_status_fix.php
php test_all_fixes.php
```

Or you can run all tests at once using the provided shell script:

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

## Interpreting the Results

The test scripts use color-coded output to indicate the status of each test:

- **[INFO]**: General information about the test being performed
- **[SUCCESS]**: The test passed successfully
- **[WARNING]**: The test found a potential issue that may need attention
- **[ERROR]**: The test failed, indicating that the fix may not be working correctly

If all tests pass, you should see mostly SUCCESS messages, especially in the TEST RESULT sections.

## Fix Implementation

The fixes were implemented in the following files:

1. **fix_custom_order_status.php**: This script fixes both issues by:
   - Updating the comment in respond_to_custom_order.php files to clarify that orders should only be created when accepted
   - Cleaning up any orders that were incorrectly created from declined custom orders

2. **login/respond_to_custom_order.php** and **chat-screen/respond_to_custom_order.php**: These files were updated to:
   - Use the correct INSERT statement with the proper column names
   - Only create orders when a custom order is accepted, not when it's declined
